Welcome to TBC's data repository. Our goal is to catalyze research on public education leadership through open data. 

Available datasets: 

1. Superintendent Research Dataset (tbc-superintendents-dataset). This is a public panel dataset tracking school superintendents in most US school districts. It is designed to be easy to merge with other education datasets.  We will update the dataset as new records become available. See the repo for source data, source code, and citation information.

2. District structure and strategy (eger-structure-strategy). This is a public dataset on district employees and organizational structures. It includes information on reporting structure, department, title, and salary information for 87 districts.  See the repo for data, data collection details, and citation information. 

Do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have questions or would like to contribute to this project.
